Find Magic: The Gathering cards by calling the Search Keyword (default: `mtg`) followed by a name.

↩ opens the card on the [Scryfall card database](https://scryfall.com/); ⌘↩ pastes the name and URL as a markdown link; ⌥↩ pastes them separated by a colon.

Tap ⇧ or ⌘Y for a preview of the card. Smaller image sizes load faster. Changing the option only comes into effect after the database is rebuilt, which you can force with `:mtgrebuild`.
