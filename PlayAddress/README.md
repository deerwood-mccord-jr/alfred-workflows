If the `close_tab` Workflow Environment Variable is `true` and the URL is supported, the browser tabs with the matching URL will close.

If the `use_watchlist` Workflow Environment Variable is `true`, streams will be added and played from [WatchList](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/master/WatchList) (a separate Workflow).

To play a stream you need [mpv](http://mpv.io/), [IINA](https://lhc70000.github.io/iina/), or [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html).
