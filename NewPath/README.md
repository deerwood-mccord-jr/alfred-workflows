Call `nf` followed by a file name (if no extension is given, `.txt` will be used) to make a new file. Calling `nfo` instead will open the files after creation.

`nd` and `ndo` behave similarly, but for directories. Two important diferences: no extension is added, and subdirectories can be created with `/`.

If a Finder window is the frontmost, the new paths will be created there, otherwise they will be created on the Desktop. Use `|` to separate the names of multiple entries (surrounding spaces will be trimmed).
